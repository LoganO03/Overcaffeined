**Game Name:** <br/>
OverCaffeinated <br/>
**Intent:** <br/>
Create a game revolving around the topics "Coffee" and "Scatter", while providing a fun and entertaining experience for the player that still has its challenges. We also wanted to incorporate a zombie avoider type concept.<br/>
**Narrative Structure:** <br/>
The narrative is a guided experience that uses an NPC to guide the player on a scavenger hunt around a city that has been infected by zombies.<br/>
**Mechanics:** <br/>
The game is controlled with keyboard inputs. In order to move the player can use WASD or arrow keys, iteration is bounded to E and dialogue progression is also bounded to E. The player is given the goal of finding items needed to make the perfect cup of coffee to save the world and cure the zombies. The player then goes to 1 of 3 zones in the game that are swarming with the undead and then using the hints that the game provides the player must hunt down the items in each area, Once the player collects all the items they return to the manager and save the world.<br/>
**Aesthetics:** <br/>
When creating our game we decided to stick to a pixel based art aesthetic. We put our setting in a city with many other areas to travel between including a suburb, a park, and a store. in the city sections we made the decision to create a more crowded screen to make it feel authentic while the suburb is in a more organized and in unison. We added sound for many of the interactions to hopefully keep the player engaged, we also used a unique font to hopefully keep the player interested and not view the game as generic.<br/>
**Joys:** <br/>
Overall this project provided a fun experience into diving deeper within the unity game engine as it combined the puzzle like feel of project 1 with added elements of controlling more of the game and the final product we put out. The usage of tile maps and such added to the puzzle like feeling of game development and creating an enviroment like the one we made provided such joy as we brought the silly concept of our game to life.<br/>
**Struggles:** <br/>
Some of the difficulties we would encounter would primarily be in the enemy interaction with the player as we tried to get the enemy to behave in a balanced way. We would also struggle with Git as this project involved us working with different things in the same file and that would cause significant merging issues. There would also be growing pains in the tile map aspect of the map creation as layers for different aspects of the map could be tricky to keep up with at times. <br/>

Logan O'Roark<br/>
Logan Contributed mostly in the map design of the city and many of the aesthetic pieces of the game as he would create many of the sprites that where not found in the tile maps used for the game. He sourced the font and the tile maps. He contributed to the dialogue boxes and some of the dialogue, and some of the interactable found in the game. He also created the Start Menu. <br/>
Niko Mannon<br/> 
Niko would contribute by creating the movement of the player, player interactions with NPCs, enemies, and objects found throughout the game. He would also create enemy behavior and actions.  Niko would also handle the sound design of the game, including sourcing the audio, handle the majority of the UI design and would contribute to the suburb map design. Niko also was the primary script writer for dialogue.
